# 3rd Party Libraries 
This CMake project downloads and builds a suite of 3rd party libraries.  In the CMakeList.txt file, They are organized in build groups and in build order.  Turn on group numbers one at a time, build each and install.  Libraries can also be built individually.  Some groups have custom install commands and others are built solo because they have target conflict with other libraries.

During the CMake configuration step, if the library source code is not locally present, a git will clone the source code to the _dep directory.  This may take a long time.  The git clone command will commence with a "Add 'library' to Build" message; A successful clone will result in "Add Build 'library' Finished" message.  Be sure to delete the CMakeCache when building new groups.
